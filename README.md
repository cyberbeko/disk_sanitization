A simple script for securely wiping disks on macOS using bash scripting. If you have an external drive or a non-critical disk, you can test the script on that disk to ensure it works. Make sure you donâ€™t test it on your main drive or anything important!

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, the goal is to create a Bash script that securely deletes files by overwriting them with random data multiple times before deletion, ensuring that they are unrecoverable. This script can be used to securely wipe sensitive data from devices before disposal or reuse, helping organizations comply with data protection laws like GDPR or HIPAA.

## Programming LanguageðŸ’»
- **Bash** (for scripting)

## Utilities Used ðŸ’¼
- **shred**: Used for secure file deletion by overwriting files multiple times to make them unrecoverable.
- **nano**: A terminal-based text editor used to create and edit scripts.
- **chmod**: A command used to make the script executable by changing its permissions.
- **terminal/Shell** (for executing commands)

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
